// psuedocode:
// Dashboard will need to import header
// dashboard will need to only be rendered when logged in
// will need boxes that will conditionally render games,
//  social, and notes pages
// beneath link boxes there will need to be carosel of top communites/recommended communities
// under carosel there will need to be a card which contains the friends list of said used
// only the first online, or most recently online users to populate on friend's list
// when friend's list is clicked it will take user to full friend's list, clicking on individual user on list will take you to their page
// TODO: Import dependencies (required files and needed packages)
// TODO: Create Div social, games, and notes (navbar? just A tags? buttons?)
// TODO: Create Div for carosel, with A tags on each image within carosel, have background linked to communities page
// TODO: Create card element for friend's list (top is linked to full friend's list, each friend on list is linked to their own pages)
